# Genuary 2022 ðŸ¦€

This repository is a collection of daily sketches made during the [genuary](https://genuary.art/) event in january 2022.

> GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.

This year I decided to use the [Nannou](https://nannou.cc) framework using Rust which was really fun! ðŸ¦€

You can click on any gif below to see the source file, enjoy!

## Setup

To setup the project you need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/johhnry/genuary-2022
$ cd genuary-2022
$ cargo run --bin day_x
```

(`day_x` is the number of the sketch in the cargo workspace)
