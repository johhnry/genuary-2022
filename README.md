# Genuary 2022 ðŸ¦€

This repository is a collection of daily sketches made during the [genuary](https://genuary.art/) event in january 2022.

> GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.

This year I decided to use the [Nannou](https://nannou.cc) framework using Rust which was really fun! ðŸ¦€
